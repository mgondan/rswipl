The purpose of this package is to embed SWI-Prolog into an R library,
such that other packages can link to the SWI-Prolog runtime without the need
to install the program on their computer. This R package is *not* meant to
be used directly. Please use the R package `rolog` instead. Install this
package if you do not have the administrative privilege to install SWI-Prolog
on your computer.

## License

This R package is distributed under FreeBSD simplified license. SWI-Prolog is 
distributed under its own license (BSD-2).
